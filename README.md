# DOM drills

* create and link index.html, styles.css, and apps.js
* link apps.js in the head element of index.html rather than the body.
* use the addEventListener and set 'DOMContentLoaded to have the html load before the JS.
* practice '.addElement' and 'addTextNode' as well as appendChild.
* created a function to pick a color at random from an array.
* applied that function to several areas as an 'event' so that text would change color when clicked.
* added function to a button.
* used the removeChild method to remove a li from the parent node.
